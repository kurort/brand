# Brand guidelines

Documentation and examples for Kurort’s logo and brand usage guidelines.

## Logo

When referencing Kurort, use our logo mark. Do not modify our logos in any way. Do not use Kurort’s branding for your own open or closed source projects.

Our logo mark is also available in black and white. All rules for our primary logo apply to these as well.
